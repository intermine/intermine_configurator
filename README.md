# intermine-configurator
a group of web services used to create an InterMine instance

Getting Started With InterMine
-------------------------------

To build the jar, run this command:

```
./gradlew build
```

Then to start the service, run this command:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

I use a chrome plugin to run the web services. None of the web services return anything yet.
